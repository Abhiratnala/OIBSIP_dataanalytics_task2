# OIBSIP_dataanalytics_task2
🧹 Data Cleaning Project
A project completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program – OIBSIP
📅 Duration: July 2025
📂 Level: 1 – Project 3

📌 Project Objective
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing real-world datasets to enhance their quality and reliability for analysis. The goal was to detect and fix inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues, making the datasets ready for further statistical or machine learning tasks.

📊 Datasets Used

🛠️ Tasks Performed
Loaded and explored two messy datasets using Pandas
Identified and handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mean/mode imputation, dropping)
Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity
Converted column formats (e.g., strings to integers, standardized date formats)
Applied outlier detection techniques to clean extreme values
Ensured consistent formatting for categorical and numerical fields

📚 Key Concepts
Data Integrity: Ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout the dataset
Missing Data Handling: Filling or dropping missing entries strategically
Duplicate Removal: Cleaning up repeated rows
Standardization: Making all values follow a uniform format
Outlier Detection: Spotting and managing data points that could bias results

💡 Skills Demonstrated
Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy
Exploratory data analysis
Problem-solving using data cleaning best practices
Interpreting and preparing raw datasets for model readiness

🚀 Outcome
The cleaned datasets are now accurate, consistent, and ready for downstream tasks such as analysis or machine learning. This project reflects a solid foundation in data wrangling and highlights the critical role of data cleaning in the data science pipeline.
